## 🌐 Vision

RouGee is a decentralized social media platform that embodies the cyberpunk ethos of digital sovereignty, fair creator compensation, and freedom from algorithmic manipulation. Powered by RougeCoin (XRGE), RouGee puts users and creators first in a world where big tech companies continue to exploit user data and control content distribution.

- **Direct Monetization** - Receive XRGE tokens directly from followers and supporters
- **Decentralized Identity** - True ownership of your digital presence and data
- **No Algorithmic Manipulation** - Content reaches followers without shadow banning or throttling
- **Community Governance** - XRGE token holders vote on platform features and policies
- **Censorship Resistance** - True freedom of expression within legal boundaries
