## Overview

RouGee is a next-generation decentralized social media platform that embodies the cyberpunk ethos of digital sovereignty, fair compensation for creators, and freedom from surveillance capitalism.

Built on blockchain technology and powered by RougeCoin (XRGE), RouGee creates a space where:
