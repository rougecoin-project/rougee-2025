## 🌐 Vision

In the current digital landscape, centralized social media giants exploit users through surveillance capitalism, algorithmic manipulation, and content censorship. RouGee offers an alternative vision:

- **Digital Sovereignty** - Users own their data and content, with full control over how they're shared
- **Direct Creator Monetization** - Content creators earn XRGE tokens directly from their audience without platform fees or algorithmic suppression
- **Community Governance** - Platform policies, features, and roadmap are decided by XRGE holders through on-chain voting
- **Privacy By Design** - No surveillance, no data harvesting, no manipulation
- **Censorship Resistance** - Content moderation is community-driven and transparent

Our platform embodies the cyberpunk ethos of resistance against corporate control and the fight for personal freedom in an increasingly digital world.

## 🚀 Features

RouGee will incorporate the following key features:

### Phase 1 (MVP)
- User profiles with crypto wallet integration
- Basic content creation and sharing (text, images)
- Direct tipping with XRGE tokens
- Content discovery feed

### Phase 2
- Content monetization tools (subscriptions, exclusive content)
- Decentralized identity integration
- Community governance mechanisms
- Advanced media support (video, audio)

### Phase 3

- Cross-chain support
- Developer API and plugins
- Advanced privacy features
